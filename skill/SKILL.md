# StoryVista | Reader Visual Codex

## Mission

Turn complex novels into multilingual visual reading companions: characters, aliases, relationships, locations, maps, objects, lore, highlighted source text, and spoiler-safe evidence.

## Required Inputs

- UTF-8 source text
- output directory
- optional `--ui-language auto|en|zh-CN|...`
- optional `--spoiler-mode safe|full`
- optional explicit visual provider or manual assets

## Run

```bash
python scripts/storyvista.py build input.txt --out output/story --ui-language auto
python scripts/storyvista.py export-prompts output/story --provider jimeng
python scripts/storyvista.py bind-images output/story --assets output/story/assets/generated
python scripts/storyvista.py rebuild-atlas output/story
python scripts/storyvista.py validate output/story
```

## Required Outputs

Create source/chunk indexes, language profile, reader text, entity links, character atlas, relationship web, location atlas, map plan, object/lore codex, visual evidence, visual asset plan, image manifest, spoiler state, provider state, theme profile, provider prompt files, manual generation instructions, actionable image-generation tasks, semantic display fallbacks, `atlas.html`, and `verification-report.md`.

## Language And Locale Rules

- Detect input language and script.
- Detect or accept UI language independently.
- Preserve canonical names and original spelling.
- Add localized labels only when useful; do not force-translate proper nouns.
- Apply language-specific alias rules conservatively.
- Mark uncertain alias merges ambiguous.
- Use English visual prompts by default unless explicitly changed.
- Load interface labels from locale files.
- Record language assumptions and locale status in verification.
- `en` and `zh-CN` are supported; other bundled locales are experimental.

## Core Pipeline

1. Run provider preflight; missing providers are not fatal.
2. Ingest and chunk source text with stable offsets.
3. Detect language, script, name system, and UI locale.
4. Set reader progress and spoiler-safe state.
5. Detect genre/atmosphere and create a spoiler-free theme profile.
6. Extract characters, places, organizations, objects, lore, relations, and events.
7. Resolve full names, titles, surnames, nicknames, and aliases conservatively.
8. Build character visual profiles and relationship/location/object codex data.
9. Build interpretive map data without inventing exact geography.
10. Build visual evidence with confirmed/contextual/inferred/unknown status.
11. Build reader paragraphs and entity links.
12. Create visual asset plan before image manifest or atlas rendering.
13. Export provider-specific prompts and expected filenames.
14. Bind direct, externally generated, or user-provided real assets when available.
15. If no image provider is callable, output a structured `Image Generation Task List` and use semantic fallbacks only as temporary display surfaces.
16. Render localized `atlas.html` with generation status, prompt actions, Reader Sync, and bidirectional jumps.
17. Validate every contract and write the verification report.

## Spoiler Rules

- Default to `safe` mode.
- Hide details marked `locked`.
- Do not place later revelations in portraits, backgrounds, summaries, or alt text.
- Full mode requires explicit user choice.

## Visual Provider Preflight

- Inspect configuration signals without printing secrets.
- A configured key is not a verified callable provider.
- Explicit user selection wins.
- Never auto-install providers, create accounts, or make paid calls.
- Before visual generation, confirm or detect whether an image model is available, whether an API key exists, whether a local service is running, whether the output directory is writable, whether rate limits are likely, and whether the user wants a text-first atlas before batch image generation.
- Provider priority: user-specified model, callable Image2, available SeeDream for mainland/cloud workflows, local ComfyUI/Flux/SDXL, then structured task list.
- Fallback order: configured direct/local provider, external manual generation, prompt pack, structured task list, semantic display fallback.
- Keep Jimeng, Jianying Jimeng, ByteDance Seedream, and Volcengine Seedream as distinct registry entries.
- Default prompt style is `creative-balanced`; `evidence-strict` and `cinematic-free` remain available planning modes.

## Image Generation Safety Rules

When no usable image model is detected, StoryVista must explicitly tell the user that no callable image model is available and list practical options: Image2, SeeDream, ComfyUI, Flux, SDXL, or another cloud/local model.

Forbidden behavior:

- generating blank placeholders as final image results
- inserting nonexistent image links
- pretending images were generated
- using broken image URLs
- using "image generation in progress" as a replacement for a real result
- outputting placeholders with no usable generation prompt

StoryVista must not treat image-link placeholders as completion. It must prioritize usable output: generate real images when possible, otherwise provide high-quality prompts and explain the unavailable provider state.

## Image Generation Task List Format

When direct generation is unavailable, include this table:

| ID | Type | Title | Source Basis | Prompt | Negative Prompt | Recommended Provider | Aspect Ratio | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| image_001 | character/location/object/event | Short asset title | Source paragraph, scene, or evidence note | Copy-ready visual prompt | Exclusions and spoiler limits | Image2 / SeeDream / ComfyUI / Flux / SDXL / other | 16:9 / 4:5 / 1:1 | high/medium/low |

## Theme Engine

- Derive theme from source motifs, not from unsupported plot assumptions.
- Keep backgrounds atmospheric, text-free, character-free, and spoiler-free.
- Record theme ID, palette, motifs, confidence, and background prompt.

## Reader Sync And Entity Jump

- Render source paragraphs with stable IDs.
- Highlight resolved characters, locations, organizations, objects, and lore.
- Clicking a highlight opens the matching codex entry.
- Clicking evidence opens the Reader panel and scrolls to the source paragraph.
- Persist reader open state, width, progress, font size, and line height locally.

## Fallback Rules

- Missing provider: tell the user no callable image model is available, create an actionable prompt workflow, output a structured task list, and continue with semantic SVG only as the temporary display fallback.
- Missing visual fact: use `unknown`, not invention.
- Ambiguous alias: keep candidates and report ambiguity.
- Missing geography: use interpretive map with a disclaimer.
- Missing locale key: fall back to English and keep experimental status.
- Never use initials-only avatars by default.

## Verification Checklist

- All required JSON/HTML files exist and parse.
- Major characters have portrait, half-body, and first-scene plans.
- Locations, map, objects/lore, and background have plans.
- Every asset has a unique manifest record and existing fallback file.
- Relation endpoints resolve and spoiler locks are preserved.
- Reader links resolve to both entities and paragraphs.
- Theme and locale are embedded in the atlas.
- Desktop and mobile Reader layouts are usable.
- No unsupported language or agent runtime is called fully supported.
- No missing-provider path claims image generation succeeded.
- Every ungenerated image has a usable task-list row with source basis, prompt, negative prompt, provider recommendation, aspect ratio, and priority.

## Final Response

Report output path, selected provider/fallback, input/UI language, theme, spoiler mode, test result, warnings, and known limitations.

Actor, writer, and director modes are future extensions, not core workflow steps.
